          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>New research has confirmed what the conventional wisdom:<br> Wealthier people have better health. The U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System has released data detailing health care indicators like access to care, obesity rates, smoking rates, income, poverty rate and age.</p>

          <p>Poorer states are more likely to be obese, smoke, and lack care. Smoking is presumably more related to cultural norms amongst various social classes than wealth, as it is difficult to smoke if one has run out of money. Health care access is probably directly related to wealth. If one can convince one's boss to spend more on one's salary, one probably also has the negotiating clout to get a good health plan. Obesity is probably a combination of the two. Wealthier socio-economic classes not only value life-long physical activity more than working classes, but can also more easily afford expensive exercise-related hobbies.</p>

          <p>Youth is much more weakly correlated with those variables. There is a slight negative correlation with income, presumably because younger states have more workers who are in the early low-earnings phase of their career. Young states have lower health care access, probably because young workers don;t have employer health insurance yet. They also seem to smoke less as they never got hooked. The correlation is very weak to non-existant, but they may also be skinner. If one is over-eating enough to gain weight, but not gain it quickly, it would stand to reason that one would be heavier as one got older. That may be what is showing up in the data.</p>
